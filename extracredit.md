Using data from the CDC, I created a bar chart that shows the number of vaccines administered during this time of the year. 

**Make sure your viz has a headline, chatter/subhed and a source. It should also use the appropriate type of visualization/colors/etc for the data you're reporting on.**

In your repository, you should turn in:

* CDC Data: https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Weekly-Cumulative-Doses-in-Millions-of-Influenza-V/k87d-gv3u
* Follow up story: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/health/flu-covid-risk.html 
* An image file with your visualization OR a link to an image file (this means no interactivity)
