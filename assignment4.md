# Assignment 4: Sketch a visualization

Using [this data](../class6/cocoabeans.xlsx), I sorted each continent's imports by year, using excel charts. 

[This line graph](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15EGIYSjCxgHhKFgdj94hKwGdjiPMsgXa/view?usp=sharing) shows imports every year with three colors distinguishing between the regions. I think it shows how Europe has imported so many more cocoa beans than Asia and Americas. With a scale of 500K, the graph also shows how little Asia and the Americas' imports have changed compared to Europe's.   

I also made another one that visualizes the percent share each continent imported in the years 2015-2019.
