## Story research

I decided to change the focus of my topic to focus the following question(s): Does political ad spending impact elections in battleground states? How has political ad spending changed over time? Is there an extreme change in the different areas (broadcast, newspaper, billboards, digital/social media)?

I want to focus on federal elections. 

One of the main areas that have been covered is whether negative or positive ads have any impact on elections or the way people vote.

Most of these studies were done by universities and media analysis agencies.

One report I found from Axios broke down the data from Wesleyan, Kantar and AdImpact really well by topic and group, which I wasn't sure was available initially. 

However, what struck me is that there weren't many stories trying to find correlation between the location and where the advertisement money wasn't spent along with a comparision into the election results. What places are getting the most investment (digital or television ads)? I'm also curious if there is a way to map out the topic and party? 

In addition to searching for other stories that have been done on this topic, please identify at least three high-quality datasets you could use in your story (you can change your mind on these later, but this is just to get you thinking about what's out there). For each, please write why the data source is trustworthy and what (if any) limitations it might have.
