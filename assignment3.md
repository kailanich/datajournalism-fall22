# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

**Due beginning of class 4**

Read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

I think one of the big issues I'll have in my search is that some of the data has already been filed as .pdf files. Since my main question also includes social media, some of the data may not be entirely trustworthy since the FCC doesn't regulate those platforms like broadcast television or radio. 
Google ads might be a great resource. However, they don't track advertisements by issue, which would be a helpful element. Instead, they focus on candidates. Their collection process may also be a mystery and big. There are so many videos and photos online, how are they even being tracked? Ultimately, I may face a lot of holes in the data which makes it harder to be exact. 

Moving forward, I'll pay close attention to very small details that may interfere with my analysis. My data will also have to take into account that Google, Facebook and stopped running political ads on their products in order to lower the spread of misinformation ahead of the 2020 election.
