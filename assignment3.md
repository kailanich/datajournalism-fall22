# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

**Due beginning of class 4**

Read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

Write a short memo in `assignment3.md` listing the "bad data" issues you may find with data in reporting your final project, and how you may be able to address them. 

Unfortunately, a huge problem with some of the data is that it has been filed as .pdf files.
