# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

**Due beginning of class 4**

Read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

I think some of the big issues I'll have in my search is that some of the data has already been filed as .pdf files. Since my main question also includes social media, some of the data may not be entirely trustworthy since the FCC doesn't regulate those platforms like broadcast television or radio. 
Google ads might be a great resource. However, they don't track advertisements by issue, which would be a helpful element. Instead, they focus on candidates. Their collection process may also be a mystery and big. There are so many videos and photos online, how are they even being tracked? 

How will I point this out in my report?
