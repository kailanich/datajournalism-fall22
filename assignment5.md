# Assignment 5: Design a visualization

Using the same data from [assignment4](assignment4.md), create a data visualization using DataWrapper. As in assignment5, it should be an appropriate visualization type for the data. It should also have all necessary components (hed, chatter, source, etc.)

Export an image of the visualization and upload it to github, titled `assignment5.png`.


## Sketch should include:

A headline
Chatter/subhed
The visualization
Source line: CBI (Centre for the Promotion of Imports)
Credit line (your name)
