# Assignment 1
By Kaila Nichols

### Clarity and accuracy
* I was able to immediately identify the central idea the reporter was trying to explain. (Rating: 4)  
  * The writer wants to present a visual of where PPP funding went across each state along with a measure of which places received the most or least. 
  * Location: Headline

* I understood how to read the visualization, but felt it was easier to hover above each state and read the percentages than using the colors. (Rating: 3)
  * While it is helpful to have that option, the individual colors should also be easily differentiated. 
  * The navigation could’ve shown the correlation or difference between “% Receiving Loans” and “% Jobs Supported.” if there was some correlation between 

* The data is mostly accurate according to the writer. (Rating: 4)
  * The article mentions that some loans went to self-employed people, so I’m curious if this can affect the numbers a little bit. A rough estimate of how many people were labelled self-employed would give more context. I also wonder if there are some small businesses that don’t fit into just one category. 
  * Sources: U.S. Small Business Administration and U.S. Census Bureau
  * Yes, these details were explained along with how Bloomberg used reports to present their data.
  
### Quality
* The data is easy to read and is crafted nicely. However, I think some of the problems lie in the colors and presentation.
  * I like the idea of showing which areas got to most aid using a lighter to darker shade. However, without using the mouse or clicking on each state, it’s hard to place a few of the areas percentage range because they look so similar. 

### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* The typography and colors were great ideas, but I think the color could have been improved upon. 
  * The design blended well with the information. My eyes went directly to the table of percentages. However, the best color for the story may have been green since the topic is about money.  
* Type (5)
  * I think the type used is Bloomberg’s standard. It was clear and easy to read. 
* Color (3)
  * A huge part of the story is the graphic of the map. I think it would be better to use green and also use the same color for each section in case people want to compare the loans received vs the jobs supported. 


### Creativity
* The piece used some creative elements. For example, while using the table, the piece emphasizes loans given and total amount by highlighting each value. 
  * This was especially helpful if you sorted the list by another value. There was a visual marker that explained the key point of the story. 
  * Rating: 4


### Story Project Ideas

1. Climate change is a very relevant topic on the national and world stage. A recent study found that a third of all plant and animal species could be extinct by 2070 due to climate change. It has also been a key part of the Inflation Reduction Act. A breakdown of investment into climate change leading up to the midterms might also show where money is going and whether it is impactful. 

 Most data will come from the US Census and EPA. One worry is that some descriptions of investment may be very broad and ambiguous, so I would laso research on the state level with offices and agencies. For this story, I’d talk to officials, but may also need some people with a personal connection to the story.

2. Earlier today we had a meeting to learn about the OpenSecrets and Follow the Money platforms.
